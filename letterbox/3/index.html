      Hello my gorgeous girl ‚ô•Ô∏è<br><br>
      I had a dream that we were living together somewhere and for some reason we had cats and one of them gave birth to 3 kittens and I was dealing with 3 wet and slippery new born cats hahahah. Maybe it&#39;s a sign üßçüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I wish I could pick which dreams I have so I&#39;d at least spend time with you in my dreams. I&#39;d take you to the hyrax land hahahah and steal you a baby one.<br><br>
      Anywayyy my cutie patootie, I miss you and I&#39;m very lucky to have you in my life.  Thank you for loving me and for being my girlfriend. I can&#39;t wait to be together in person soon and give you the biggest hug and a smooch ever.<br><br>
      I love you so so so so much my boss baby ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
