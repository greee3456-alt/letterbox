      Hello Reemskiii,<br><br>
      I read your message many times and I&#39;m very sorry for all the pain and disappointment I have brought. You are my whole world and the most important woman in my life and I know that I haven&#39;t been showing you that. I&#39;m sorry for making you feel like I don&#39;t care about you and that I didn&#39;t put effort into improving many things I have promised to. I&#39;m sorry I have been taking you for granted.  I never wanted you to feel like you were begging for my attention or like I was giving you the bare minimum.<br><br>
      I don&#39;t want to lose you and I don&#39;t want you to feel like I am pushing you away. I love you boba and I know that you deserve a lot more than what I have been giving you. I want to and will work on myself and fight for you. Please know that I love you, and I don&#39;t want this to end.<br><br>
      I know words aren&#39;t enough anymore and that you are tired but I will show you that I can change with actions. I want to fight for and cherish you every single day.<br><br> 
      I love you more than I have ever been able to put into words Reemskiii ♥️
