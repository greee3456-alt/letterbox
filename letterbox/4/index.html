      It&#39;s so cold and grey now. Also gets dark early and I keep daydreaming about us cuddling and cooking food when it&#39;s cold outside. For some reason I like spending time together when it&#39;s this kind of weather and season. Feels very cozy haha. I wanna just sit with u under blankets and watch something while it&#39;s snowing outside. That&#39;s like a dream setting hahah. Feels extra magical, cos being with you already is. Also to have ur bussing food while watching üëÄ I also keep reminiscing how we were kind of celebrating New Year/Christmas  early and decorated the little tree with funny ornaments. It was very cuteeeeee. And I also wanna see you unwrap gifts again.<br><br> 
      I miss you my little cutest cutie ever‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
